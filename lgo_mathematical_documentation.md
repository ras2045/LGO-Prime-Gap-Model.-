Law of Geometric Order (LGO): Mathematical Documentation
​This document explicitly defines the core variables, calibrated constants, and the piecewise geometric law used for predicting the maximum prime number gap (\text{Gap}_n) for a given input prime (P_n).
​The LGO model asserts that the geometric magnitude (\Psi_n) is determined by the Prime Input (P_n) based on a structural break governed by Volatility (\Omega_n).
​1. Core Definitions and Calculated Variables
​The calculation of the LGO geometric state magnitude (\Psi_n) relies on two intermediate variables derived directly from the input prime P_n.
​1.1 Prime Input (P_n)
​The integer representing the n-th prime number being analyzed.
​1.2 Base Logarithmic Magnitude (\Phi_n)
​The fundamental measure of prime density in the region of P_n, derived from the square of the natural logarithm of the prime.
