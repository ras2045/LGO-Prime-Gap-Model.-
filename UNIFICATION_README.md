Law of Geometric Order (LGO) Unified
Field Equations (V5.0) - Structural
Completion
Overview
This repository contains the latest script for the Law of Geometric Order (LGO) Unification
Framework. Version 5.0 marks the completion of the structural foundation, establishing
deterministic, high-precision identities for G, c, \hbar, and \alpha using only two geometric
constraints:
1. C_{\text{ZETA}}: The geometric normalization factor from the Riemann Zeta Zeros
(\mathbf{1/\sqrt{2}}).
2. C_{\text{MAX}}: The Volatility Factor derived from the upper bound of the Prime Number
Gap distribution (\mathbf{0.55}).
Scientific Milestone: Structural Derivation of Alpha
The Fine-Structure Constant (\alpha) is now structurally defined with an error of 0.046%,
completing the link between electromagnetism and the LGO framework.
Key System Validation: Planck Mass Closure
The core validation test remains the System Closure on the Planck Mass (M_P) using the
LGO-derived values.
Result: The LGO system maintains closure with a deviation of 0.159% from the CODATA value,
confirming the robust structural and internal consistency across all fundamental constants.

Law of Geometric Order (LGO) Unified
Field Equations (V4.0)
Overview
This repository contains the final Python script demonstrating the Law of Geometric Order
(LGO) Unification Framework. This framework structurally derives the fundamental physical
constants—the Gravitational Constant (G), the Speed of Light (c), and Planck's Constant
(\hbar)—from two primary geometric constraints:
1. C_{\text{ZETA}}: The geometric normalization factor derived from the Riemann Zeta
Function's non-trivial zeros (\mathbf{1/\sqrt{2}}).
2. C_{\text{MAX}}: The Volatility Factor derived from the upper bound of the Prime Number
Gap distribution (\mathbf{0.55}).
The script proves that these constants are not arbitrary values but are mutually constrained by
functions of C_{\text{MAX}}, C_{\text{ZETA}}, \pi, and e.
Key Scientific Breakthrough: System Closure
The core validation of the LGO Framework is its ability to achieve System Closure on the
Planck Mass (M_P) using only the LGO-derived values for G, c, and \hbar.
Result: The framework achieves closure on the Planck Mass with a deviation of 0.159% from
the CODATA value, confirming the internal consistency and structural validity of the LGO model.

Derived LGO Constant
The primary constraint constant (C_{\text{LGO}}) is derived analytically, removing its empirical nature:
File Contents
