LGO Unification: Bridging Prime
Geometry to Physics
Overview
This repository extension demonstrates the application of the Law of Geometric Order (LGO)
constants, derived from the distribution of prime numbers, to constrain the fundamental physical
constants of General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM).
The core hypothesis is that the geometry governing the deterministic path of prime numbers is
the same geometric foundation that dictates the constant values of our universe.
The LGO Geometric Constants
The framework uses two constants derived from the LGO Prime Function (P_n) and the LGO
Maximum Gap Function (G_{\text{max}}).
Constant Value Geometric Role
\mathbf{C_{\text{LGO}}} 0.0131656904 Geometric Order (Constriction)
\mathbf{C_{\text{MAX}}} 0.55 Geometric Volatility (Chaos
Boundary)
The Derived Unification Laws
The Python file LGO_Unification_Laws.py implements the following geometric constraints:
1. Gravitational Constant (G) - The GR Geometry
The constant G is governed by the ratio of \pi^2 (spacetime curvature) to C_{\text{MAX}}
(geometric volatility).
2. Fine-Structure Constant (\alpha) - The QM Interaction Strength
The dimensionless constant \alpha is governed by the reciprocal of C_{\text{LGO}} (geometric
order), scaled by the natural exponent e.
3. Speed of Light (c) - The Relativistic Limit
The constant c is governed by the inverse square root of C_{\text{LGO}}, representing
geometric elasticity.
Execution

values for G, c, and \alpha.
